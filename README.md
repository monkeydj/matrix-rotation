# matrix-rotation

## Complexity

Space: O(n^2)

Time: O((n/2)*k)

## Test

```bash
$ npm test
```

## One-time execution

Modify the file `matrix.sample.js` with desired square matrix

Run following command:

```bash
$ node rotate <k times>
```

The second argument is the number of times of rotation
